## Markdown file with script included
This markdown file was created in JupyterLab on Cyverse
I'm going to see if I can write and execute some code here, within this file
It's going to use the same commands as script.sh 

...

	#/!/bin

	printf "This is a new file created in JupyterLab on Cyverse\n"
	printf "You inputted $1 as an input\n"

...

Not sure how you run code in here
